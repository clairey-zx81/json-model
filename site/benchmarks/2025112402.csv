## Tool Performance Summary

For each tool: number of best performance, number of case failures, overall
validation speed in bytes per µs, maximum/geometrical average/minimum performance ratio.

<!-- LRRRRRRR -->
"best count",5,31,1,0,0,0,0
"broken count",2,0,0,0,0,0,0
"speed B/µs",1050,1714,797,810,505,510,83
"ratio max",37.82,2.60,29.31,9.91,32.50,29.90,55.27
"ratio geo-avg",2.52,1.08,5.45,4.77,8.32,6.85,24.01
"ratio min",1.00,1.00,1.00,1.56,1.69,2.55,5.83

## Tool Performance Per Case

For each case: number and name, number of test cases, best cumulated median performance (µs),
best tool, performance slowdown ratio for blaze and jmc variants (java 1 is gson, 2 is jackson,
3 is jsonp/johnzon), the lower the better, **1.0** is best, empty denotes a tool failure.

<!-- RLRRCRRRRRRR -->

## Result Success

For each tool and cases with a partial success rate, percent of test cases validated.

## Compilation Per Case

For each tool and case, compilation time in second.
Tool `s2m` is initial schema-to-model conversion.

Tool `s2m` is initial schema-to-model conversion.

<!-- LRRRRRR -->
"avg compile time (s)",0.8,1.1,2.1,0.9,2.2,1.0

## Cases Statistics

For each case and a summary: the schema and model sizes (number of lines, model size 1
denotes a reference to a predefined model), number/min/average/max size of test values.
